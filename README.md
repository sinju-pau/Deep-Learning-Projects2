# Machine Learning : Business Analytics

This repository covers my humble analysis of datasets using various Machine Learning algorithms with varying complexities for Business Analytics. The analysis is performed in Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files) and other notebooks. A working knowledge of Python is required to read through the scripts.

Here's a list of notebooks illustrating some of my current projects:


1.  [Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing: Decision Support Systems using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Business-Analytics/blob/master/PredictSuccessofBankTelemarketing.ipynb)

2.  [Bank Credit Card Default Predictions using various classification algorithms using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Business-Analytics/blob/master/CreditcardDefaultsData.ipynb)

3.  [Predicting social media performance metrics of posts published in brands' Facebook page, using Regression analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Business-Analytics/blob/master/FacebookMetrics.ipynb)

3.  [Predicting Lending Club's Loan Status, Analysing features using Deep Learning in Tensorflow and Keras in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Loan.ipynb)

4.  [Deep Learning: Neural Networks for Retail Product Category Predictions - using Tensorflow & Keras in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/OnlineRetailProductSegment.ipynb)

5. [Machine Learning: Financial Fraud/ Money-Laundering Detection - using Spark and Python in DataBricks environment](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/2754224716007874/3360987816541135/6194880497615233/latest.html)








## Install

**For Python**

This repository requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**For TensorFlow and Keras**

TensorFlow is a popular Deep Learning framework by Google, the installation instructions can be read [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/). Similarly for Keras goto : [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)

**For R**

This repository requires **R** and the installation instructions and support can be obtained at :[R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html)

To install the libraries in R, appropriate codes will be given at the beginning of the notebook

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution, which already has the above packages (including R) and more included. Make sure that Python 3.6 installer is selected. 

## Code

Template code is provided in the `.ipynb` notebook files. Note that separate files such as `.py` or `.R` are not included in the repository. You can jump to the notebooks clicking on the links in appropriate sections.

## Run

Download the required notebooks. In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory(that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook notebookname.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook notebookname.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

## Data

The data files, as `.csv`, `.txt`, or `.xls`, may required to be downloaded through the source links provided in the notebook and be saved in the same directory as the notebook file.
