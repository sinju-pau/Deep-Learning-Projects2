# Machine Learning : Business Analytics

This repository covers my humble analysis of datasets using various Machine Learning algorithms with varying complexities for Business Analytics. The analysis is performed in Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files). A working knowledge of Python is required to read through the scripts.

Here's a list of notebooks illustrating some of my current projects:


1.  [Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing: Decision Support Systems using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Business-Analytics/blob/master/PredictSuccessofBankTelemarketing.ipynb)

2.  [Bank Credit Card Default Predictions using various classification algorithms using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Business-Analytics/blob/master/CreditcardDefaultsData.ipynb)
